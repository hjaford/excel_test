Situation

"The MBTA provides the fourth largest paratransit operation in the nation, The RIDE, serving a 712 square mile area including 60 cities and towns with a combined population of 2.5 million. In FY17, The RIDE provided approximately 1.8 million trips to registered customers and 2.1 million total trips, including personal care assistants and companions. The RIDE is provided generally daily from 5:00 am through 1:00 am, mirroring and in some cases exceeding all MBTA bus and rail service days and hours. The Fiscal and Management Control Board would like to be briefed on the usage of the paratransit service to help determine the performance of the service. The provided data include the record of every single trip taken during one week from June 11, 2017 to June 17, 2017."






Assignment

"1) Determine the performance of the service using desired performance metrics, at minimum include:
- Average trip time 
- Average speed of the system (miles per hour)
- On-time performance (OTP)  
[OTP= Percentage of pickup trips with pickup time no later than 15 minutes after the promised time and appointment trips with drop-off time no later than 10 minutes after the appointment time]
- Histogram of number of customers based on average trip mile

2) Calculate the ratio of total number of trip to total number of vehicle by time of day using the weekly average excluding the weekend (i.e., Monday-Friday average for each time slice 9-10am, 10-11am, etc.)
3) Please create a 1-4 PowerPoint slides summarizing your findings, making sure to include at least one graphical representation and one key recommendation.
4) Qualitatively and quantitatively depict any surprising trends and recommendations for changes in service based on the data."
